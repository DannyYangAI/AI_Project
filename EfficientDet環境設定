After running "python setup.py build_ext --inplace" I got the file "compute_overlap.cp36-win_amd64.pyd" which I renamed to "compute_overlap.pyd". I added the .pyd from retinanet/utils to efficientdet/utils and I was able to start training
python train.py --snapshot imagenet --phi  1 --gpu 0 --random-transform --compute-val-loss --freeze-backbone --batch-size 32 --steps 1000 pascal datasets/VOC2012


compute-val-loss拿掉，如果沒有驗證集


parser.add_argument('--tensorboard-dir', help='Log directory for Tensorboard output',
                        default='logs\\{}'.format(today))
                        
logs/ 改成logs\\ , windows下 路徑才不會ERROR
vscode 整合tensorboard ,how to launch

有存tensorboard 的log , 目前vscode 支援 tensorboard , 說明如下：
To start a TensorBoard session, open the command palette (Ctrl/Cmd + Shift + P) and search for the command “Python: Launch TensorBoard”. Afterwards, 
you will be prompted to select the folder where your TensorBoard log files are located. 
By default, we will use your current working directory and automatically detect your TensorBoard log files within any subdirectories, 
but you can also specify your own directory. VS Code will then open a new tab with TensorBoard and its lifecycle will be managed by VS Code as well.
